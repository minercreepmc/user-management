## Purpose

The User Management service handles user registration, authentication, and authorization. It manages user profiles, addresses, and preferences, ensuring the security of user data.

## Strategic Classification

1. **Domain**: Core Domain - User management is a key strategic initiative. It's crucial for the functioning of the system as it handles user registration, authentication, and authorization. It's also responsible for managing user profiles, addresses, and preferences, ensuring the security of user data.
2. **Business Model**: Compliance Enforcer - While it doesn't directly generate revenue or user engagement, it's essential for protecting the business reputation and existence. It ensures that only authorized users have access to certain resources and that user data is handled securely.
3. **Evolution**: Product - User management is a well-explored domain, and off-the-shelf versions exist with differentiation. However, specific business requirements often necessitate custom-built or tailored solutions.
